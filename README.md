# Telemetry Agreement

By using this bot, you agree to LICENSE for the software included. You also agree to an external clause regarding telemetry:

> This piece of software collects telemetry in order to provide you with the best of results. Telemetry capture is encrypted and stored away; however, the owner may request a retrieval or a deletion of their telemetry history. Certain data may be visible to the host, but SHALL NEVER BE shown to the general public. Doing so will be a clear violation of this clause that is an extra addendum to the original LICENSE.
