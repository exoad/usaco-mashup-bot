# Setting this bot up

This bot does not come running out of the bot (for obvious reasons).

# Pregenerated Data

If you do not wish to run the Scraper, you may use the scraped data that I have generated in

/bin/scraper.txt

This is not meant to be kept up to date, as I will only run it after every season ONLY.

This pregeneration is also very slow in order to not overwhelm the host (currently set around 50ms)

## Layout of the generated data:

```
PROBLEM-URL DIVISION YEAR MONTH PROBLEM# PROBLEM-NAME
...
PROBLEM-URL DIVISION YEAR MONTH PROBLEM# PROBLEM-NAME
```
Notice: Header attributes, like when the file was generated are only provided when the Scraper calls the Parser to convert it to JSON.
