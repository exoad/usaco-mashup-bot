Telemetry capture is encrypted and stored away; however, the owner may request a retrieval or a deletion of their telemetry history. Certain data may be visible to the host, but SHALL NEVER BE shown to the general public. Doing so will be a clear violation of this clause that is an extra addendum to the original LICENSE.
